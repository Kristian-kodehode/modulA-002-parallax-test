      <h2>Snow leopard</h2>
      <p>
        The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known as the ounce, is a felid
        in the genus Panthera native to the mountain ranges of Central and South
        Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global
        population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals
        and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by
        poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural developments.
        It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500
        m, ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan
        Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China.

      <h2>Bald Eagle</h2>
      <p>
        The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish,
        which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons.
        It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest
        tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep,
        2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Sexual
        maturity is attained at the age of four to five years. Bald eagles are
        not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word,
        "white headed".

      <h2>Whale Shark</h2>
      <p>
        The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is
        rarely found in water below 21 °C (70 °F).Studies looking at vertebral
        growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming sharks have estimated
        whale shark lifespans at 80 to 130 years. Whale sharks have very large
        mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in
        only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They
        feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes, and pose no threat
        to humans.
